# - [BOOKNOTES]: Managers Path On Team Lead

> The tech lead role is not a point on the ladder, but a set of responsibilities that any engineer may take on once they reach the senior level. This role may or may not include people management, but if it does, the tech lead is expected to manage these team members to the high management standards of RTR tech. These standards include:

# - [BOOKNOTES]: Manager's Path On Processes

> As a new tech lead, be careful of relying on process to solve problems that are a result of communication or leadership gaps on your team. Sometimes a change in process is helpful, but it’s rarely a silver bullet, and no two great teams ever look exactly alike in process, tools, or work style. My other piece of advice is to look for self-regulating processes. If you find yourself playing the role of taskmaster—criticizing people who break the rules or don’t follow the process—see if the process itself can be changed to be easier to follow. It’s a waste of your time to play rules cop, and automation can often make the rules more obvious.

# - [BOOKNOTES]: Manager's path on why a leader should write code

> Why bother writing any code if all you’re doing is small stuff? The answer is that you need to stay enough in the code to see where the bottlenecks and process problems are. You might be able to see this by observing metrics, but it’s far easier to feel these problems when you’re actively engaged in writing code yourself. If the build is really slow or deploying code takes too long or on-call is a nightmare, you’ll feel it in the difficulties you, an experienced engineer, have in knocking out trivial programming tasks

# empowerment model

employee empowerment model that includes three degrees of empowerment.3
  1. The first level encourages employees to play a more active role in their work. 
  2. The second level asks employees to become more involved with improving the way things are done
  3.. The third level enables employees to make bigger and better decisions without having to engage upper management. The third level is key for an Agile culture.
